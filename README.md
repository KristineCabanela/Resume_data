Plan - Acquire - Prepare - Explore - Model - Deliver

- Wrangle
    - Acquire data
    - Prepare data by doing a cleanup of null values, duplicates, removed unnecessary outliers.
    - We will create a function that we can reference later to acquire and prepare the data by storing the function in a file name wrangle.py
    - We will split our data to a train, validate, and test
- Explore
    - Create visualizations of data to pin point key drivers of happiness
    - Create a visualizations correlating to hypotheses statements
    - Run at least two statistical tests that will support whether the hypothesis has been rejected or not
- Modeling
    - Establish baseline
    - Ensure models are tested on appropriate validate and test datasets
    - Determine best performing model and test on test dataset
- Delivery
    - Final Report in Jupyter Notebook
    - README with project details
    - Python modules with acquire and prepare functions
